# search-image 

This is a study to create a Flask app as quickly as possible. The flask components are relatively light-weight. It's a simple image gallery with a search function (search by image tags or by color). All image data is pulled from Unsplashed's API. Focusing in on an image links to the image author's original. API calls are handled by Flask, whereas async features (lazy loading, infinite scrolling, image lightbox) are JS.
